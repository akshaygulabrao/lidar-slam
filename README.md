# LIDAR SLAM
This repository contains a reference implementation for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) with LIDAR point clouds.

I use the [Newer College Dataset](https://ori-drs.github.io/newer-college-dataset/stereo-cam/) as an example. It contains X,Y,Z. They provide the data in a rosbag format.

I recommend using [Foxglove Studio](https://docs.foxglove.dev/docs). The allow you to easily create new layouts. You can find my layout in four-camera.json.
